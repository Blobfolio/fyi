/// # Before and After.
///
/// This is a potentially useful companion to [`Progless`](crate::Progless) that tracks an
/// arbitrary non-zero before and after state. It was created to make it easire
/// to track before/after file sizes from minification-type tasks, but it
/// doesn't ascribe any particular meaning to the data it holds.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Usage is as simple as:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use fyi_msg::BeforeAfter;
///
/// let mut ba = BeforeAfter::start(123_u64);
///
/// // Do some stuff.
///
/// ba.stop(50_u64);
/// ```
///
/// Once before and after are set, you can use the getter methods [`BeforeAfter::before`]
/// and [`BeforeAfter::after`] to obtain the values.
///
/// For relative changes where `after` is expected to be smaller than `before`,
/// there is [`BeforeAfter::less`] and [`BeforeAfter::less_percent`] to obtain
/// the relative difference.
///
/// For cases where `after` is expected to be larger, use [`BeforeAfter::more`]
/// and [`BeforeAfter::more_percent`] instead.
